# SE333 Assignment 6

## GitHub Repository
Please reference GitHub repository link: playwright-bookstore-tests(https://github.com/LDIAZGOM/playwright-bookstore-tests)

## GitHub Actions
The GitHub Action is configured to execute all tests. All tests must pass for the workflow to succeed.

## Reflection
This project did not implement two approaches for automating UI testing using Playwright, just the not AI one:

1. **Direct element locators and interactions**  
   - Selected elements explicitly using getByRole, getByText, and locator.
   - Worked reliably with the current website structure.


**Conclusion:** The direct locator approach was more stable and reliable, ensuring all tests pass and the workflow succeeds.
